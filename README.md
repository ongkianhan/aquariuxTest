This source code is used to develop a crypto trading system with SpringBoot framework and an in-memory H2 database.

More improvements could be added:
 1) Robust JUnit tests to ensure code coverage and correct functionality
 2) Depending on the database, the structure of class hierarchies might change, and some composite primary keys can be streamlined for efficiency.
